**What is groundwater?**

Groundwater makes up 99% of Earth’s liquid freshwater. Groundwater is
stored in aquifers below the Earth’s surface and is one of the most
important natural resources (see Figure 1). Groundwater is used for drinking water,
crop irrigation, and agricultural production. Many ecosystems and
wildlife depend on groundwater, such as salamanders in wetlands and fish
in rivers.

**How do we measure and quantify groundwater?**

Groundwater can be challenging to monitor, being that it is underground.
Groundwater wells are drilled into the ground to measure water depth,
water quality, and the presence of pollutants. Long-term groundwater
monitoring is important to quantify groundwater levels in aquifer basins
over time and to better understand how drought and groundwater
extraction is impacting this finite natural resource. Groundwater can
also be easily contaminated from human activities such as leakage from
landfills, agricultural or urban runoff, and atmospheric pollution, to
name a few. Measuring and monitoring for pollutants and groundwater
levels is crucial.

Groundwater can be measured in “depth to groundwater” or “elevation." 
The depth to groundwater is how deep the water lies below the Earth’s
surface. Whereas, the elevation is measured by subtracting the depth to
groundwater from the surface elevation.

**Why is this analysis needed and important?**

Groundwater is replenished or recharged by rain or snowmelt that seeps
into the Earth’s surface (see Figure 2). However, many people in the world face water
shortages due to the over extraction of groundwater at a rate that is
faster than the recharge. Many people also lack access to clean drinking
water as groundwater is easily polluted by a multitude of chemicals,
PFAS, and toxic metals. As an important source for drinking water,
irrigation for food production, and supporting groundwater-dependent
ecosystems, this analysis is crucial to better understand how
groundwater depth and quality impact different socioeconomic groups.
