All GSAs have submitted their GSP to the Department of Water Resources. Most were approved with recommended corrective actions to be reassessed in 5 years. 12 of the critically overdrafted basin GSP were determined incomplete, and 6 were inadequate. This includes basins in Kern County. Of the high and medium priority basin GSP, so far the Department of Water Resources has determined 6 to be incomplete as well. GSAs with incomplete GSP have received required corrective actions and 180 days to address deficiencies in their plan; if the deficiencies are not addressed, the GSP will be categorized as inadequate. Inadequate GSP lead to state board intervention, relinquishing local control of water resources to the state. 



Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSP) may address management from either a supply or demand approach or a combination of both. Many basins, especially those with large-scale agricultural operations, are reluctant to impose regulations on how much groundwater can be used by businesses, residents and farmers. Methods to increase groundwater supply include managed aquifer recharge (MAR).



One of the solutions for groundwater depletion in California is Flood Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR). In Flood-MAR, landowners voluntarily flooding their land during high precipitation events, allowing the water to infiltrate the soil, percolate downward, and recharge Californiaâ€™s aquifers. A limiting factor that could disqualify otherwise optimal locations for participating in flood-MAR is what elements are present in the soil. Soluble compounds present in high concentrations in the soil are likely to dissolve into the water and contaminate the groundwater as it recharges the aquifer. Due to human activities such as pesticide and fertilizer use in agriculture, wastewater treatment, and other chemical industrial processes, soils and surface waters can contain many harmful compounds. Elements of concern include Lead, Copper, Mercury, and Arsenic. Unfortunately, the California State Water Resources Control Board lacks consistent historical data for these chemicals across the state.
