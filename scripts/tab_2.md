Wells for extracting groundwater have existed in California longer than it has been a state. California does not get much precipitation compared to other parts of the world, especially in the southern half of the state. Therefore, groundwater was necessary to grow its urban centers: Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and to irrigate the Central Valley, one of the most fertile areas of land in the world. 

Counties that are more populated and/or heavier in agriculture tend to deplete groundwater faster than counties with less residents and agriculture. Kern County, home to the Kern Water Bank, stores millions of acre-feet of freshwater delivered from Northern California by the California Aqueduct as part of the State Water Project.
