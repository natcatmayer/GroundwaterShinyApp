The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act was passed in California in 2014 by Governor Jerry Brown with the intent of securing groundwater supplies for future generations and placing water management under local control. The goal is to achieve groundwater sustainability by 2040. 



California watersheds are classified as low priority, medium priority, high priority, or critically overdrafted based on eight variables: population, projected population growth, number of public supply wells, number of total wells, amount of irrigated acres, groundwater reliance, documented impacts, and the state of natural ecosystem and habitat. 



The act required medium and high priority basins to form Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSA) and create a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP) by 2022, and critically overdrafted basins to do the same by 2020. A GSP is meant to avoid six undesirable results in the basin: declining groundwater level, diminished groundwater storage capacity, land subsidence, seawater intrusion, impacted surface water systems, and degraded water quality. Southern California counties that were required to submit a GSP include: San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Kern.
